Notes
-------
* Activation
Some networks require activation to allow this service.

* Charges
Most networks provide this service completely free, but some do not. It is advisable to check 
with your own provider to check this out before using the service heavily. In most cases the cost
of the message is covered by standard texting plans (e.g. free texts). Note however that it is the
receiver that will pay any associated charges - hence the reason for activation above.
